# Group 24 Firefighter Robot Code

* The `src` directory contains all source code (Python files) including the `utils` library.
* `src/main.py` is the entrypoint of the program, which should be run using `python3 main.py` on the BrickPi.
* The `main` branch should only contain code which has been tested and is known to work.
* Each team member should work on their own branch under their own name.
* If a new feature is being tested and contributed to by multiple people, such as a new sensor or navigation logic, it should have its own branch until it is known to work well and will be merged into `main`.
* `src/colour_detection.py` contains utility functions for detecting colours. Other functionality should ideally be split into its own file.
* Code documentation beyond this readme goes in the `docs` directory and should be in markdown format like this.
* All other files have been removed. They can be restored as needed using git.
